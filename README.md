# DEPRECATED
This library is from a time long past.  Ledger has since released new JavaScript libraries for interfacing with a ledger that have completely different APIs, including improved error messaging.  While they still don't address the problem of multiple simultaneous connections, this can easily be solved inline with a semaphore like:
```typescript
try {
	await this.lock.acquire()
	return await this.ledger.signTransaction(this.derivationPath, rlpEncodedTransactionAsHexString)
} finally {
	this.lock.release()
}
```

There are some known vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies of this library and they are unlikely to be addressed since they come from Ledger packages that have been deprecated.  There are no known attack vectors through these vulnerabilities, but you should use this library with caution.

----

A wrapper library around the official Ledger JavaScript library that attempts to simplify usage and handle various failure modes/problems.

# Usage

```typescript
import { LedgerEthereum, BrowserLedgerConnectionFactory, Network } from "ethereumjs-ledger";

async function doStuff() {
	const onConnectLedgerRequest = async () => { await promptUserToConnectLedger(); }
	const onOpenEthereumAppRequest = async () => { await promptUserToOpenEthereumAppOnLedger(); }
	const onSwitchLedgerModeRequest = async () => { await promptUserToSwitchEthereumAppToBrowserModeAndRestartEthereumApp(); }
	const onEnableContractSupportRequest = async () => { await promptUserToEnableContractSupportInEthereumAppAndRestartEthereumApp(); }

	const ledgerEthereum = new LedgerEthereum(Network.Main, BrowserLedgerConnectionFactory, onConnectLedgerRequest, onOpenEthereumAppRequest, onSwitchLedgerModeRequest);
	const address = await ledgerEthereum.getAddressByBip44Index(0);
	const firstSignedMessagePromise = ledgerEthereum.signTransactionByBip44Index("e8018504e3b292008252089428ee52a8f3d6e5d15f8b131996950d7f296c7952872bd72a2487400080", 7);
	const secondSignedMessagePromise = ledgerEthereum.signTransactionByBip32Path("e8018504e3b292008252089428ee52a8f3d6e5d15f8b131996950d7f296c7952872bd72a2487400080", "m/44'/60'/0'/0/7");

	// this will block until both first and second messages are done because the library handles ordering internally
	const secondSignedMessage = await secondSignedMessage;

	// if the ledger isn't connected with the Ethereum app open in browser mode, the on*Request callbacks above will be called before the signing promises return
	const firstSignedMessage = await firstSignedMessage;

	// BIP44 index 7 is the same as `m/44'/60'/0'/0/7`; it is strongly recommended to use index 0 if you don't support multi-address wallets
	assert.equal(firstSignedMessage, secondSignedMessage);
}
```

# Development

### Note 1
`package-lock.json` force updates `node-hid`, a transitive dependency of `ledgerco` to `0.6.0`.  This is necessary to get things working on Windows without requiring python as well as get tests working in Docker until `ledgerco` upgrades its dependency on `node-hid` to `0.6.0`.

### Testing with a physical ledger
You can test in node by building the TypeScript files and then running `node output/scripts/node.js`.

You can test in browser (chrome only, look at developer console) by building the TypeScript files and then running `npx budo output/scripts/browser.js --ssl` (note: you need openssl binaries on your path or in the root of your project).
